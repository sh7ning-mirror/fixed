**Summary**

A fixed place numeric library designed for performance.

All numbers have a fixed 8 decimal places, and the maximum permitted value is +- 9999999999,
or just under 100 billion.

The library is safe for concurrent use. It has built-in support for binary and json marshalling.

It is ideally suited for high performance trading financial systems. All common math operations are completed with 0 allocs.

**Design Goals**

Primarily developed to improve performance in [go-trader](https://github.com/robaho/go-trader).
Using Fixed rather than decimal.Decimal improves the performance by over 20%, and a lot less GC activity as well.
You can review these changes under the 'fixed' branch.

If you review the go-trader code, you will quickly see that I use dot imports for the fixed and common packages. Since this
is a "business/user" app and not systems code, this provides 2 major benefits: less verbose code, and I can easily change the
implementation of Fixed without changing lots of LOC - just the import statement, and some of the wrapper methods in common.

The fixed.Fixed API uses NaN for reporting errors in the common case, since often code is chained like:
```
   result := someFixed.Mul(NewS("123.50"))
```
and this would be a huge pain with error handling. Since all operations involving a NaN result in a NaN,
 any errors quickly surface anyway.
